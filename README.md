This is Rise and Shine, a smart, IoT alarm clock that doesn't
stop ringing until you get out of bed. It uses computer vision to detect
if the user is still in bed, and if he/she isn't it keeps ringing the alarm
until the person gets out of bed.

This idea was inspired by my personal experiences struggling to not hit snooze.
It is not uncommon that I hit snooze 2-3 times before actually waking up.
Even when I do, I sometimes just rot in bed for 10 minutes doing nothing.

This alarm does not allow that.

It will keep ringing as long as you're in bed. You can customize the sound
and wake up time via a webapp.

Hope you find it interesting!
